# Rumour Detection with PyTorch

Welcome to the Rumour Detection repository! This project focuses on implementing and exploring various configurations for rumour detection using PyTorch. The repository not only includes the PyTorch implementation of the classification models but also features an intuitive interface for easily tuning, testing different training configurations, and adapting preprocessing steps.


## Key Features

- **PyTorch Implementation:** The core of this project is robust rumour detection models built with PyTorch, offering a powerful and flexible framework for training and evaluation.

- **Configurable Interface:** An easy-to-use interface allows users to tune different aspects of the training process using a `config.ini` file. This empowers users to experiment with various hyperparameters and configurations effortlessly.

- **Google Sheet Reporting:** Some of the results of model training experiments are reported to this [**Google Sheet**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HSW92__FzxiRzxJaF7wNpTlthKCVXSMhCuj72LsNzPo/edit?usp=sharing), providing a clear overview of model performance under different settings. All of the reported models were trained just by editing `config.ini` file.


- **Downloadable Models:** Some of the Pre-trained models, resulting from experiments with various hyperparameters, are available for download in the provided google sheet. These models can be directly applied or serve as a starting point for further fine-tuning.
